ideas
* use spatialized audio to pan according to kite placement
* reverb and other effects
* add a drum / some kind of beat (where does the beat come from)
* determine tempo from some outer source (might be fluctuating)
* find nice chord progression and arpeggios
* play certain parts of the piece when a key is pressed but dont be proscriptive about ordering
